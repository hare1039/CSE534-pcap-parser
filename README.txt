Requirement: Please use a c++ compiler that support c++17 or greater.
Notice my code will trigger a strange bug in MacOS clang (Apple clang
version 11.0.0 (clang-1100.0.33.8)), so please use g++ or vanilla clang++
to compile my code.
Compile command: `make`. If `make` didn't work, please read the Makefile.
