[1] congestion window size

My algorithm of estimating congestion window is record sum all packet size within 1 RTT.
We get RTT values from part A, and we can use that to do the estimation. Congestion window
is a value of maximum packet that can send from sender. We can calculate how many bytes
sent within RTT, because that is highly related to congestion window. The code section
is in analysis_pcap_tcp.cpp part b function.
We can see that congestion window grows multiplicativly in all flows. Though it is not
factor of 2.


[2] retransmission and dup ACK
flow 1)
  0 packet retransmissions
  1 packet timeout
flow 2)
  173 packet retransmissions
  4 packet timeout
flow 3)
  407 packet retransmissions
  95 packet timeout

Retransmission are calculate as receiver ACK same sequence number over 3 times.
Code section is part_b_2() in analysis_pcap_tcp.cpp.
